# Movie Recommendation System (Content-based Filtering)
This project focuses on developing a content-based movie recommendation system. The process is divided into the following steps:

# 1. Data Collection and Preparation
Data Collection: Gather movie data, including titles, genres, and descriptions.
Data Analysis & Cleaning: Explore and clean the dataset to ensure it is suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the key patterns and distributions in the data.
# 2. Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Text Preprocessing: Use NLP tools to process movie descriptions and other textual data.
Corpus Creation: Compile a collection of text data for analysis.
CountVectorizer: Convert text data into a matrix of token counts.
Stemming: Apply Porter Stemmer to reduce words to their base or root form.
# 3. Movie Similarity Analysis
Cosine Similarity: Calculate the similarity between movies based on their content, using the cosine similarity metric.
# 4. Model Persistence
Pickle Library: Save the trained model and other necessary data using Pickle for future use.
# 5. Deployment
Streamlit Application: Deploy the recommendation system as a web app using Streamlit, making it accessible for users to receive movie recommendations.
